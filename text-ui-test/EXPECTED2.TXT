	Booting Up...

	Ah, there you are! The moon is bright, the code is flowing, and caffeine-wait, I mean
	motivation-fuels our mission tonight. Welcome back to Night Coder, your loyal (and slightly
	sleep-deprived) coding companion. Whether it's wrangling deadlines, or organizing your todo
	list, I'm here to lend a hand.

	Let's make some magic together. What's on the docket tonight?

	If you're unsure about what I can do, just type "help", and I'll get you sorted in no time!

	[ Night Code Command Guide ]
	Need a hand? No problem! Here's what I can do for you:

	    help
	    - Prints this handy guide. Because even pros need reminders sometimes.

	    todo <String>
	    - Adds a to-do task to your list. Just tell me what needs doing, and I'll keep track.
	      Example: todo Finish the project report

	    deadline <String> /by <String>
	    - Adds a task with a deadline. Perfect for those time-sensitive missions!
	      Example: deadline Submit assignment /by 2025-01-30 23:59

	    event <String> /from <String> /to <String>
	    - Adds an event with a start and end time. Keep your schedule sharp!
	      Example: event Team meeting /from 2025-01-21 3:00 PM /to 2025-01-21 4:00 PM

	    list
	    - Shows all your tasks. Think of it as your personal task constellation.

	    mark <int>
	    - Marks a task as complete. Use the task number from the list.
	      Example: mark 1

	    unmark <int>
	    - Marks a task as incomplete. Sometimes things need a second look!
	      tExample: unmark 1

	    delete <int>
	    - Deletes a task from your to-do list. Use the task number from the list.
	      Example: delete 2

	    bye
	    - Exits the program. But don't be a stranger-I'll be here when you need me again!

	Got it? Let's get back to work!

	[ Night Code Command Guide ]
	Need a hand? No problem! Here's what I can do for you:

	    help
	    - Prints this handy guide. Because even pros need reminders sometimes.

	    todo <String>
	    - Adds a to-do task to your list. Just tell me what needs doing, and I'll keep track.
	      Example: todo Finish the project report

	    deadline <String> /by <String>
	    - Adds a task with a deadline. Perfect for those time-sensitive missions!
	      Example: deadline Submit assignment /by 2025-01-30 23:59

	    event <String> /from <String> /to <String>
	    - Adds an event with a start and end time. Keep your schedule sharp!
	      Example: event Team meeting /from 2025-01-21 3:00 PM /to 2025-01-21 4:00 PM

	    list
	    - Shows all your tasks. Think of it as your personal task constellation.

	    mark <int>
	    - Marks a task as complete. Use the task number from the list.
	      Example: mark 1

	    unmark <int>
	    - Marks a task as incomplete. Sometimes things need a second look!
	      tExample: unmark 1

	    delete <int>
	    - Deletes a task from your to-do list. Use the task number from the list.
	      Example: delete 2

	    bye
	    - Exits the program. But don't be a stranger-I'll be here when you need me again!

	Got it? Let's get back to work!

	Alright, signing off for now. Remember, even the brightest coders need some rest-yes, I'm
	looking at you! ( 0 w 0 )
	If you need me, you know where to find me. Until next time, keep dreaming big, debugging smart,
	and chasing that moonlit inspiration.
	Goodnight, and happy coding!

	Powering Down...
